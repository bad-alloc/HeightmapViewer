In order to build the heightmap viewer you'll need boost and
Irrlicht. These libraries haven't been included to avoid redundancy,
old libraries and save space:

* libIrrlicht 1.8.0
* Irrlicht 1.8.0 headers
* libboost_filesystem 1.54.0
* libboost_system 1.54.0
* libboost_program_options 1.54.0

(Newer versions of the libraries should also work.)

Boost and Irrlicht can be downloaded here:
* http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads/
* http://www.boost.org/users/download/

If you don't want to change the Makefile, create a folder lib/ and
place both libIrrlicht.a and the irrlicht include/ folder there. The
boost libraries go in lib/boost1_54_0_installed_lib.

Otherwise, just point LIBINCLUDE to the place where you put your
libraries. Set LIRR to the position of libIrrlicht.a and change the
paths of the boost .so files in LBOOST. If you have installed these
libraries on your system it should be sufficient to add the following
parameters to LDFLAGS: -lIrricht -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system
-lboost_program_options (LIRR and LBOOST can be removed in this case).
